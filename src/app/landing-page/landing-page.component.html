      <h2>What are Oxalates?</h2>
      <p>
        Oxalates in food are naturally occurring compounds found in many plants.
        They are a type of organic acid that can bind with minerals like
        calcium, forming calcium oxalate. This compound is not easily absorbed
        by the body and can accumulate in the kidneys, potentially leading to
        the formation of kidney stones.

      <h2>What are Oxalates?</h2>
      <p>
        Oxalates in food are naturally occurring compounds found in many plants.
        They can accumulate in the body, causing health problems. They are most
        well known for causing kidney stones, but can cause a myriad of other
        potential issues.

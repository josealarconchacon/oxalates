  "title": "Managing Oxalate Intake",
  "description": "Oxalate, or oxalic acid, is an organic compound found in many fruits and vegetables. Although foods high in oxalates can provide health benefits, consuming oxalates in large quantities can cause issues for certain populations.

So, even though these foods can be healthy, consuming them in moderation is advised for some individuals.",
